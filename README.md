https://github.com/cupertank implemented essential data structures presented in src/model, src/parser, src/tests and src/util

# Installation guide
* ## Ubuntu
  The following instructions were tested on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS.
  ### Dependencies
  Prior to cloning the repository and attempting to build the project, ensure that you have the following software:

  - GNU g++ compiler, version 10+
  - CMake, version 3.10+
  - Boost library, version 1.72.0+

  ### Building the project
  Firstly, navigate to a desired directory.
  Then, clone the repository, cd into the project directory and launch the build script:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Mstrutov/Desbordante/    
  cd Desbordante
  ./build.sh
  ```
  ### Launching the binaries
  The script generates the following file structure in `/path/to/Desbordante/build/target`:
  ```bash
  ├───inputData
  │   └───some-sample-csv's.csv
  ├───fdtester_test
  ├───fdtester_run
  ```
  The `inputData` directory contains several .csv files that may be used by `fdtester_test`. Run `fdtester_test` to perform unit testing:
  ```
  cd build/target
  ./fdtester_test
  ```
  The tool itself is launched via the following line:
  ```
  ./fdtester_run --algo=tane --data=<dataset_name>.csv
  ```

  The `<dataset_name>.csv`, which is a user-provided dataset, should be placed in the `/path/to/Desbordante/build/target` directory.

* ## Windows
  The following instructions were tested on Windows 10 .
  ### Dependencies
  Prior to cloning the repository and attempting to build the project, ensure that you have the following software:

  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
  - CMake, version 3.10+
  - Boost library, version 1.65.1+ \
    The recommended way to install Boost is by using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)  

  ### Building the project
  Firstly, launch the command prompt and navigate to a desired directory.
  Then, clone the repository, cd into the project directory and launch the build script:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Mstrutov/Desbordante/    
  cd Desbordante
  build.bat
  ```
  *Note:* to compile the project, the script uses hard-coded path to MSVC developer command prompt, which is located
  by default at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat`.
  You should change the path in the script if it differs from the default one.
  ### Launching the binaries
  The script generates the following file structure in `\path\to\Desbordante\build\target`:
  ```bash
  ├───inputData
  │   └───some-sample-csv's.csv
  ├───fdtester_test.exe
  ├───fdtester_run.exe
  ```
  The `inputData` directory contains several .csv files that may be used by `fdtester_test`. Run `fdtester_test` to perform unit testing:
  ```
  cd build\target
  fdtester_test.exe
  ```
  The tool itself is launched via the following line:
  ```
  fdtester_run.exe --algo=tane --data=<dataset_name>.csv
  ```

  The `<dataset_name>.csv`, which is a user-provided dataset, should be placed in the `\path\to\Desbordante\build\target` directory.
