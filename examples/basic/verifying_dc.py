A more advanced example of using Denial Constraints is located in examples/expert/data_cleaning_dc.py.

DC verification is performed by the Rapidash algorithm:

print("""DC φ is a conjunction of predicates of the following form:
∀s, t ∈ R, s ≠ t: ¬(p_1 ∧ . . . ∧ p_m)

DCs involve comparisons between pairs of rows within a dataset.
A typical DC example, derived from a Functional Dependency such as A -> B,
is expressed as: "∀s, t ∈ R, s ≠ t, ¬(t.A == s.A ∧ t.B ≠ s.B)".

This denotes that for any pair of rows in the relation, it should not be the case
that while the values in column A are equal, the values in column B are unequal.\n
Consider the following dataset:

print("""And the following Denial Constraint:
!(s.State == t.State and s.Salary < t.Salary and s.FedTaxRate > t.FedTaxRate).\n
We use "and" instead of "∧" and "¬" instead of "!" for easier representation.

The constraint tells us that for all people in the same state a person with a higher salary has a higher tax rate.
Then we run the algorithm in order to see if the constraint holds.

The issue is that for the last record (Texas, 5000, 0.05), there are people in Texas with a lower salary
but a higher tax rate.

Such pairs of records that contradict a DC are called violations. We can retrieve these 
violations from the algorithm object. In this case, the following pairs are the violations:
{viol_str}, where each number is an index of a record in the table.
