testing of the algorithm. Furthermore, we need to fix it in this example for demonstration 
purposes; otherwise, we may obtain a different number of intervals with different boundaries 
that will not correspond to the text we wrote for our output.

(15-22). This means that the difference between the dispatch date and delivery date always 
falls within these intervals, except for three rows where the difference lies outside the 
discovered ranges. From this, we can infer that:
{COLOR_CODES["bold_yellow"]}Packages for some addresses are typically delivered within 7 days.{COLOR_CODES["default"]}
{COLOR_CODES["bold_yellow"]}Packages for some addresses take up to 22 days.{COLOR_CODES["default"]}

nearby addresses versus far addresses; 2) air shipping versus regular shipping.

for further investigation, which requires additional context. There are many possible reasons 
for this: 1) on these dates there was a workers' strike in some regions; or 2) an incorrect 
address was specified, which increased the delivery time; or 3) it is just a typo in the table.

the discovered ranges.
However, with this number of intervals, it is difficult to draw immediate conclusions about the 
delivery date. In this case, a detailed analysis of other attributes might enable more meaningful 
predictions for delivery times. For example, it may be a good idea to partition data by the region 
attribute (or by month/quarter) and consider each partition individually. 
'''
)

print(
'''Another option is to try to find a parameter combination that will result in a smaller number of 
intervals. Next, remember that the algorithm is randomized (unless you run it with the exact 
settings) â€” it can skip some rows, so you can also try to alter the seed.

Thus, the quantity and quality of the intervals are the user's responsibility. It may take several 
attempts to achieve something interesting. Experiment!'''
