print('''==============================================
In Desbordante, we consider an approximate inclusion dependency (AIND)
as any inclusion dependency (IND) that utilizes an error metric to measure
violations. This metric calculates the proportion of distinct values in the
dependent set (LHS) that must be removed to satisfy the dependency on the
referenced set (RHS) completely.

The metric lies within the [0, 1] range:
- A value of 0 means the IND holds exactly (no violations exist).
- A value closer to 1 indicates a significant proportion of LHS values violate
      the dependency.

Desbordante supports the discovery and verification of both exact INDs and AINDs:
1) Exact INDs: All values in the LHS set must match a value in the RHS set.
2) Approximate INDs (AINDs): Allows for controlled violations quantified by the
error metric.

For discovery tasks, users can specify an error threshold, and Desbordante will
return all AINDs with an error value equal to or less than the specified
threshold.

The error metric used for AINDs in Desbordante is an adaptation of g3,
originally designed for approximate functional dependencies (FDs).

1) Unary and n-ary inclusion dependency discovery in relational databases by
   Fabien De Marchi, StÃ©phane Lopes, and Jean-Marc Petit.
