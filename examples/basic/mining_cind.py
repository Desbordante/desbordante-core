    ========================================================================
    This example demonstrates Desbordante"s ability to process
    conditional inclusion dependencies (CIND"s) discovery algorithm.
    
    We consider CIND as approximate inclusion dependency (AIND), which 
    scope defined by conditions set over one or more attributes. These
    conditions utilizes the precision and recall metrics to represent their
    validity (condition matches only included data) and completeness
    (condition matches all included data) respectively. Also, there are 2
    types of conditions: "row" condition counts metrics for data tuples,
    and "group" condition counts them for sets of entries, grouped by their
    inclusion attributes. 
    
    Given algorithm discovers every CIND, whose conditions has given type
    and condition metrics are not worse, than user-specified thresholds.
    
    For more information about CIND, consider:
