## Getting Started

To get started, choose the feature you'd like to explore (such as a particular type of FD), and run the example with [Python](https://www.python.org/)

```bash
python3 examples/basic/mining_fd.py
```

> :warning: The examples need to be run from the *desbordante* folder and not the *examples* folder as they contain references to datasets in the form of 'examples/datasets'

## Examples' Repository Structure

Examples are separated based on what they illustrate:

+ [Basic](https://github.com/Desbordante/desbordante-core/tree/main/examples/basic) — showcases a primitive and gives an example of how to use that primitive using our Python interface.
+ [Advanced](https://github.com/Desbordante/desbordante-core/tree/main/examples/advanced) — demonstrates the differences between various primitives.
+ [Expert](https://github.com/Desbordante/desbordante-core/tree/main/examples/expert) — illustrates how you can create advanced functionality using primitives.
