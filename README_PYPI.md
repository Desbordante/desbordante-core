# Main Features

[**Desbordante**](https://github.com/Desbordante/desbordante-core) is a high-performance data profiler that is capable of discovering and validating many different patterns in data using various algorithms. 

The **Discovery** task is designed to identify all instances of a specified pattern *type* of a given dataset.

The **Validation** task is different: it is designed to check whether a specified pattern *instance* is present in a given dataset. This task not only returns True or False, but it also explains why the instance does not hold (e.g. it can list table rows with conflicting values).

The currently supported data patterns are:
* Functional dependency variants:
    - Exact functional dependencies (discovery and validation)
    - Approximate functional dependencies, with g<sub>1</sub> metric (discovery and validation)
    - Probabilistic functional dependencies, with PerTuple and PerValue metrics (discovery)
* Graph functional dependencies (validation)
* Conditional functional dependencies (discovery)
* Inclusion dependencies (discovery)
* Order dependencies:
   - set-based axiomatization (discovery)
   - list-based axiomatization (discovery)
* Metric functional dependencies (validation)
* Fuzzy algebraic constraints (discovery)
* Unique column combinations:
   - Exact unique column combination (discovery and validation)
   - Approximate unique column combination, with g<sub>1</sub> metric (discovery and validation)
* Association rules (discovery)

This package uses the library of the Desbordante platform, which is written in C++. This means that depending on the
algorithm and dataset, the runtimes may be cut by 2-10 times compared to the alternatives.

## Usage examples

1) Discover all exact functional dependencies in a table stored in a comma-separated file with a header row. In this example the default FD discovery algorithm (HyFD) is used.


```python
import desbordante

TABLE = 'examples/datasets/university_fd.csv'

algo = desbordante.fd.algorithms.Default()
algo.load_data(table=(TABLE, ',', True))
algo.execute()
result = algo.get_fds()
print('FDs:')
for fd in result:
    print(fd)
```

```text
FDs:
[Course Classroom] -> Professor
[Classroom Semester] -> Professor
[Classroom Semester] -> Course
[Professor] -> Course
[Professor Semester] -> Classroom
[Course Semester] -> Classroom
[Course Semester] -> Professor
```

2) Discover all approximate functional dependencies with error less than or equal to 0.1 in a table represented by a
   .csv file that uses a comma as the separator and has a header row. In this example the AFD discovery algorithm Pyro
   is used.

```python
import desbordante

TABLE = 'examples/datasets/inventory_afd.csv'
ERROR = 0.1

algo = desbordante.afd.algorithms.Default()
algo.load_data(table=(TABLE, ',', True))
algo.execute(error=ERROR)
result = algo.get_fds()
print('AFDs:')
for fd in result:
    print(fd)
```

```text
AFDs:
[Id] -> Price
[Id] -> ProductName
[ProductName] -> Price
```

3) Check whether metric functional dependency “Title -> Duration” with radius 5 (using the Euclidean metric) holds in a
   table represented by a .csv file that uses a comma as the separator and has a header row. In this example the default
   MFD validation algorithm (BRUTE) is used.

```python
import desbordante

TABLE = 'examples/datasets/theatres_mfd.csv'
METRIC = 'euclidean'
LHS_INDICES = [0]
RHS_INDICES = [2]
PARAMETER = 5

algo = desbordante.mfd_verification.algorithms.Default()
algo.load_data(table=(TABLE, ',', True))
algo.execute(lhs_indices=LHS_INDICES, metric=METRIC,
             parameter=PARAMETER, rhs_indices=RHS_INDICES)
if algo.mfd_holds():
    print('MFD holds')
else:
    print('MFD does not hold')
```

```text
MFD holds
```

4) Discover approximate functional dependencies with various error thresholds. Here, we are using a pandas DataFrame to load data from a CSV file.

```python-repl
>>> import desbordante
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> pyro = desbordante.afd.algorithms.Pyro()  # same as desbordante.afd.algorithms.Default()
>>> df = pd.read_csv('examples/datasets/iris.csv', sep=',', header=None)
>>> pyro.load_data(table=df)
>>> pyro.execute(error=0.0)
>>> print(f'[{", ".join(map(str, pyro.get_fds()))}]')
[[0 1 2] -> 4, [0 2 3] -> 4, [0 1 3] -> 4, [1 2 3] -> 4]
>>> pyro.execute(error=0.1)
>>> print(f'[{", ".join(map(str, pyro.get_fds()))}]')
[[2] -> 0, [2] -> 3, [2] -> 1, [0] -> 2, [3] -> 0, [0] -> 3, [0] -> 1, [1] -> 3, [1] -> 0, [3] -> 2, [3] -> 1, [1] -> 2, [2] -> 4, [3] -> 4, [0] -> 4, [1] -> 4]
>>> pyro.execute(error=0.2)
>>> print(f'[{", ".join(map(str, pyro.get_fds()))}]')
[[2] -> 0, [0] -> 2, [3] -> 2, [1] -> 2, [2] -> 4, [3] -> 4, [0] -> 4, [1] -> 4, [3] -> 0, [1] -> 0, [2] -> 3, [2] -> 1, [0] -> 3, [0] -> 1, [1] -> 3, [3] -> 1]
>>> pyro.execute(error=0.3)
>>> print(f'[{", ".join(map(str, pyro.get_fds()))}]')
[[2] -> 1, [0] -> 2, [2] -> 0, [2] -> 3, [0] -> 1, [3] -> 2, [3] -> 1, [1] -> 2, [3] -> 0, [0] -> 3, [4] -> 1, [1] -> 0, [1] -> 3, [4] -> 2, [4] -> 3, [2] -> 4, [3] -> 4, [0] -> 4, [1] -> 4]
```

## I still don't understand how to use Desbordante and patterns :(

No worries! Desbordante offers a novel type of data profiling, which may require that you first familiarize yourself with its concepts and usage. The most challenging part of Desbordante are the primitives: their definitions and applications in practice. To help you get started, here’s a step-by-step guide:

1) First of all, explore the guides on our [website](https://desbordante.unidata-platform.ru/papers). Since our team currently does not include technical writers, it's possible that some guides may be missing.
2) To compensate for the lack of guides, we provide several examples for each supported pattern. These examples illustrate both the pattern itself and how to use it in Python. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/Desbordante/desbordante-core/tree/main/examples).
3) Each of our patterns was introduced in a research paper. These papers typically provide a formal definition of the pattern, examples of use, and its application scope. We recommend at least skimming through them. Don't be discouraged by the complexity of the papers! To effectively use the patterns, you only need to read the more accessible parts, such as the introduction and the example sections.
4) Finally, do not hesitate to ask questions in the mailing list (link below) or create an issue.

**Currently only manylinux2014 (Ubuntu 20.04+, or any other linux distribution with gcc 10+) is supported**.

```bash
$ pip install desbordante
 ```

## Installation from sources

Install all dependencies listed in [README.md](https://github.com/Desbordante/desbordante-core/blob/main/README.md).

Then, in the Desbordante directory (the same one that contains this file), execute:

## Troubleshooting
### No type hints in IDE
If type hints don't work for you in Visual Studio Code, for example, then install stubs using the command:
```sh
pip install desbordate-stubs
```
**NOTE**: Stubs may not fully support current version of `desbordante` package, as they are updated independently.
