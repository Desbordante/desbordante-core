/**
 * HyFD is a hybrid functional dependency discovery algorithm, employing both row-efficient
 * sample-based agree set generation and column-efficient lattice traversal.
 *
 * The algorithm has three major components: Sampler, Inductor and Validator --- the former two
 * representing row-efficient step. Sampler acquires a collection of agree sets using a special
 * deterministic sampling approach, then Inductor uses this data to enrich an FD prefix tree. This
 * concludes the first step and the execution moves to Validator, which performs breadth-first
 * bottom-up traverse of the FDTree, validating the FDs and specializing incorrect candidates.
 *
 * It is difficult to come up with a criteria or an algorithm for choosing the optimal point to move
 * from the first step to the second, therefore HyFD uses a notion of efficiency to track how
 * efficient current step is performing and switches to the other step in case it falls beneath a
 * configured threshold. Each step's results are useful for the other step: Sampler-Inductor
 * specialize the prefix tree, which reduces the number or costly PLI checks Validator has to
 * perform, while Validator yields a collection of row pairs, which invalidated a candidate and can
 * be used by Sampler to obtain a new agree set.
