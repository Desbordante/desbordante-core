    // the former situation beforehand. If an LHS does not appear again, then, due to lattice
    // invariants, it can only mean that all the previously collected MDEs with said LHS were
    // invalidated and so will never be collected again. Thus, we do not have to remember that MDEs
    // with that LHS were ever collected. Note, it is possible for an MDE with the same LHS as one
    // of the "forgotten" ones to appear, but it will have a different RHS, so that doesn't matter.
